# Bi-Directional-Visitor-Counter
Arduino-based Smart Entrance Management.

## Introduction
The Bi-Directional Visitor Counter is a smart and efficient project based on Arduino microcontroller interfacing with various components, including sensors and resistors. This innovative counter is designed to accurately count the number of people entering and leaving a location, such as a hall, mall, home, office, parking area, or other public places. By utilizing PIR (Passive Infrared) sensors and advanced Arduino Uno R3 capabilities, this system ensures accurate and real-time counting in both directions.
