# Bi-Directional-Visitor-Counter
Arduino-based Smart Entrance Management.

## Introduction
The Bi-Directional Visitor Counter is a smart and efficient project based on Arduino microcontroller interfacing with various components, including sensors and resistors. This innovative counter is designed to accurately count the number of people entering and leaving a location, such as a hall, mall, home, office, parking area, or other public places. By utilizing PIR (Passive Infrared) sensors and advanced Arduino Uno R3 capabilities, this system ensures accurate and real-time counting in both directions.

## Features
**Bi-Directional Counting**: The system allows simultaneous counting of people entering and exiting a designated area, ensuring accurate visitor tracking.

**Multi-Application Usage**: The project can be deployed in various locations, such as halls, malls, homes, offices, parking areas, and public places, facilitating crowd management and data collection.

**Smart Sensor Placement**: The accurate placement of PIR sensors at entrance and exit gates ensures precise and reliable visitor counting.

**User-Friendly Display**: The LCD 16 x 2 display provides real-time information, making it easy for users to monitor the current visitor count effortlessly.

**Flexible Sensitivity Adjustment**: The inclusion of the 250 kΩ potentiometer allows users to adjust the sensitivity of PIR sensors based on specific location requirements.

**Real-Time Data**: The system instantly updates and displays the visitor count, allowing users to make informed decisions regarding crowd control and resource allocation.

## Components Used
**Arduino Uno R3**: The Arduino Uno R3 serves as the central processing unit, managing data processing and control logic.

**LCD 16x2**: The 16 x 2 LCD display provides clear and concise real-time information about the current visitor count.
